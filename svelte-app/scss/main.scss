// main.scss
// Even though it is the root file for styles, this file will only have imports of other scss files

// first, we import the required scss partials
@import "variables";
@import "base";

// then, we import our custom css
@import "components/welcome";

// finally, we import the overrides needed for customizing third-party css
@import "overrides";
